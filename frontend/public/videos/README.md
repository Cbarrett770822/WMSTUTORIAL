# Video Placeholders

This directory should contain video files for each warehouse process tutorial. For the application to work properly, you'll need to add video files with the following names:

- `placeholder-receiving.mp4` - For the Receiving process tutorial
- `placeholder-putaway.mp4` - For the Putaway process tutorial
- `placeholder-inventory.mp4` - For the Inventory Management process tutorial
- `placeholder-picking.mp4` - For the Order Picking process tutorial
- `placeholder-packing.mp4` - For the Packing process tutorial
- `placeholder-shipping.mp4` - For the Shipping process tutorial
- `placeholder-returns.mp4` - For the Returns Processing tutorial

You can create your own tutorial videos or use placeholder videos during development. The application is designed to play these videos and synchronize them with the step-by-step tutorial content.

## Video Requirements

- Format: MP4 (recommended)
- Resolution: 1280x720 or higher
- Duration: 5-10 minutes per process
- Content should align with the steps defined in the processData.js file
